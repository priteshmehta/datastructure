##Bubble Sort
<li> Better than selection sort but not so efficient.
<li> Time complexity in worst case: **O(n2)**

##Selection Sort
<li> Most intuitive and simplest one in my opinion.
<li> Time complexity in worst case: **O(n2)**


##Insertion Sort
<li> better than selection sort and bubble sort
<li> Time complexity in worst case **O(n2)**


##Quick Sort
<li> It is better in smaller input compare to merge sort, both sorting algo works on divide and concur
<li>Time complexity in best case **O(n)** and average **case O(log n), worst case O(n2)**
