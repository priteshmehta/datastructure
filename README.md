## Bubble Sort
<li> Better than selection sort but not so efficient.
<li> Time complexity in worst case O(n2)

## Selection Sort
<li> Most intuitive and simplest one in my opinion.
<li> Time complexity in worst case O(n2)


## Insertion Sort
<li> better than selection sort and bubble sort
<li> Time complexity in worst case  O(n2)


## Quick Sort
<li> It is better in smaller input compare to merge sort, both sorting algo works on divide and concur
<li>Time complexity in best case O(n) and average case O(log n) worst case O(n2)

## Merge sort::

<li> Better than Selection,Bubble and insertion sort. Works best in large input data
<li> Time complexity in worst case: O(n log n)
