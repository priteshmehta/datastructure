## Bubble Sort
<li> Better than selection sort but not so efficient.
<li> Time complexity in worst case</li> **O(n2)**

## Selection Sort
<li> Most intuitive and simplest one in my opinion.
<li> Time complexity in worst case</li> **O(n2)**


## Insertion Sort
<li> better than selection sort and bubble sort
<li> Time complexity in worst case </li> **O(n2)**


## Quick Sort
<li> It is better in smaller input compare to merge sort, both sorting algo works on divide and concur
<li>Time complexity in best case</li> **O(n)** and average **case O(log n) worst case O(n2)**
